# Stopwatch-lap-timer
Part of a Udemy course called '30 HTML CSS & JavaScript projects in 30 Days for Beginnners' by Norbert B Menyhart. I wanted to practice practical 
application of javascript and seeing how it would work from scratch.

## Concepts Practiced In This Project
--Set Intervals
--@keyframes
--animations
--Event listeners
-- appendChild
--overlays for the background

##Things That can be improved
--You can keep hitting stop and having the same time 'logged' underneath the timer. Perhaps make it so the button can only be pressed once and can't be pressed again unless 
the Start button has been pressed.
